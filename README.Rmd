Laksetap is a R Golem Shiny App for reporting salmon and rainbow trout losses 
in Norway. 

It is published at [apps.vetinst.no/laksetap](https://apps.vetinst.no/laksetap).

## Running the app localy

The app runs with dummy data locally without the need to be connected to VI's 
server. The dummy data is distributed as part of the package in [inst/extdata](inst/extdata). 
For anyone interested in implementing  the app with their own data, running 
the app from [dev/run_dev.R](dev/run_dev.R)  will load the app with the dummy 
data. The `dev` folder also contains definitions of the data sets and scripts 
to test the visualization functions with the dummy data.

## Translating the app

All labels used in the app are in [inst/app/www/labels_nb_no.json](inst/app/www/labels_nb_no.json). Translating the `.json` file and providing the new file as an `golem option` in `run_app.R` will make the app use a different language for labels on UI inputs, and other HTML elements. The long form text (i.e. more than a few words) is in separate `.md` files [inst/app/www/](inst/app/www/).
