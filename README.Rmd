Laksetap is a R Golem Shiny App for reporting salmon and rainbow trout losses 
in Norway. 

It is published at [apps.vetinst.no/laksetap](https://apps.vetinst.no/laksetap).

It is also distributed with dummy data. For anyone interested in implementing 
the app with their own data, running the app from [dev/run_dev.R](dev/run_dev.R) 
will load the app with the dummy data. The `dev` folder also contains definitions
of the data sets and scripts to test the visualization functions with the dummy
data.
