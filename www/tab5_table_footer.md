Median (1stâ€“3rd quartile) mortality risk for completed production cycles of salmon,
distributed by production areas, counties, and for all of Norway.
Production areas with fewer than five sites with completed production cycles are not included.
The median represents the middle value, meaning that half of the production cycles had lower mortality and half had higher mortality.
The interquartile ranges show the middle 50% of the sites, providing an indication of where most of those who completed production cycles fall.
