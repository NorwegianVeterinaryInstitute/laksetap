Median (1stâ€“3rd quartile) mortality risk for completed production cycles of salmon,
distributed by production areas, counties, and for all of Norway.
Production areas with fewer than five sites with completed production cycles are not included.
The dots inside the boxes represent the mean, meaning that half of the production cycles had lower mortality and half had higher mortality.
The colored boxes indicate the interquartile ranges, which are the intervals of mortality for half of the sites.
