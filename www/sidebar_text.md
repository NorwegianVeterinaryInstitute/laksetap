The figures are sourced from monthly reports submitted to the Directorate of Fisheries.
For more information on how these statistics are compiled, please refer to the “About the Statistics” tab.
Users can choose whether to view total losses (under the “Losses” tabs) or only losses due to mortality (under the “Mortality” tabs).
In addition, the data can be displayed for different time periods: monthly, annually, and for completed production cycles.
It is also possible to calculate mortality using your own data (under the “Calculator” tabs).
