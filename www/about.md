#### Data sources

Losses of Atlantic salmon during the seawater production phase, from the first month of stocking to slaughter, are reported to the Directorate of Fisheries as of February 2025. Losses are categorized as **dead**, **discards**, **escapes**, and **other**.

- **Dead** refers to fish that are physically removed from the cage and recorded as dead due to various causes.  
- **Discards** are downgraded fish sorted out at the slaughterhouse and deemed unfit for human consumption, for example due to sexual maturation, blemishes, or deformities.  
- **Escapes** refer to fish that have escaped due to accidents.  
- **Other** includes fish lost for reasons not covered by the other three categories.

These figures form the basis for the tables presented in this app.

#### Data processing

There are two types of tables: one for **“Losses”** and one for **“Mortality”**.

The **“Losses”** table includes data on all sea-transferred Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, covering market fish, broodstock, and fish under research, development, and educational licenses.

**“Mortality”** is reported **monthly**, **annually**, and by **production cycle**.
The monthly mortality rate per site is calculated as the total number of registered dead fish divided by the number of fish at risk of dying during that month. Since the number at risk can vary throughout the month, it is estimated as the average number of live fish at the beginning and end of the month.

Average monthly mortality rates are calculated for each county, production area, and at the national level. These monthly rates are then combined to estimate the annual cumulative mortality rate.
To estimate the overall risk of a fish dying during the year, this rate is converted into an annual cumulative mortality risk using a method that accounts for how risk builds up over time (Toft et al., 2004; Bang Jensen et al., 2020; Moldal et al., 2025).
The result represents the probability that a fish will die over the course of a year, expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100%.

Production cycle mortality is calculated in a similar way but covers the entire seawater phase of the production cycle, which can range from 8 months to over a year depending on the site.

Monthly and annual mortality summaries include data from various license types (market fish, broodstock, research, development, and education).
For production cycle mortality, exclusion criteria are applied to include only sites with market fish licenses.

#### Geographic area

Users can choose to view data aggregated by **county**, **production area**, or at the **national** level.
County boundaries are based on those in effect as of January 2024.
Visualization at the county level may not be available in this version of the app.
Production areas refer to the 13 production areas defined in the Regulation (FOR-2017-01-16-61).
To ensure confidentiality, production areas or counties with very few sites are excluded.
