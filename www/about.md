#### Data Sources

Loss of Atlantic salmon during the seawater production phase—from sea transfer to slaughter—reported to the Directorate of Fisheries as of February 2025.
Losses are categorized as dead fish, discarded, escaped, and “other”.
Dead fish includes mortality due to disease, injury, etc. Infectious diseases are among the most significant biological and economic loss factors in aquaculture.
Discards refer to downgraded fish sorted out at slaughter.
“Other” may include mortality episodes related to lice treatment and handling, as well as fish culled during disease control efforts.

These figures form the basis for the tables presented here.

#### Data Processing

There are two types of tables: one for “Losses” and one for “Mortality.”

For “Losses,” data includes all sea-transferred Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, including market fish, broodstock, and fish from research, development, and educational licenses.
These figures show how many fish died, were discarded, escaped, etc., per year.
Percentages indicate the share of total losses represented by each category (e.g., the proportion of losses due to mortality, discards, or escapes).

“Mortality” is reported in monthly summaries, annual statistics, and at the production cycle level.
It is calculated using reported numbers of dead and live fish at the end of each calendar month (at the site level), using recognized epidemiological methods that account for changes in the population of live fish over time.
The monthly mortality rate per site is calculated as the number of dead fish divided by the number of fish at risk of dying that month.
The number of fish at risk is estimated as the average of the number of live fish at the beginning and end of the month
(Toft et al., 2004; Bang Jensen et al., 2020).

Average monthly mortality rates are then calculated for each area or nationally, and summed to produce the annual cumulative mortality risk, using a specific formula that accounts for accumulating risk over the year.
This cumulative risk quantifies the probability that a fish will die within a given year or production cycle, expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100%.

Monthly and annual mortality summaries include data from various licenses (market fish, broodstock, research, development, and education).
For production cycle mortality, exclusion criteria are applied to retain only sites with market fish licenses.
Production cycle mortality includes only sites with salmon that have spent 12 months or more in the sea.

#### Geographic Area

Users can choose to view data aggregated by county, production zone, or national level.
County boundaries as of January 2024 are used.
Visualization at the county level may not be available in this version of the app.
Production zones refer to the 13 zones defined in the Regulation on Production Areas (FOR-2017-01-16-61).
Production areas or counties with very few sites are excluded to ensure confidentiality.
